> 🔒 **Security**: This application includes **password protection**. **Important**: Set the `SITE_PASSWORD` environment variable in your deployment to secure your site. If not set, a default password is used (not secure for production). See [PASSWORD_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](./docs/PASSWORD_PROTECTION_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.

- **Deployment**: Vercel (Recommended)

## Getting Started

### Recommended for non-technical users (One-Click Deploy)

Use this if you're not familiar with coding. You'll deploy to Vercel and only need to copy/paste one SQL file into Supabase.

**Prerequisites:**
- Supabase account (free) - [Sign up](https://supabase.com)
- Vercel account (free) - [Sign up](https://vercel.com/signup)
- GitHub account (free) - [Sign up](https://github.com/signup)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/con2000us/Wilbur-s-rewardbook&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,SITE_PASSWORD)

**Steps:**
1. **Set up Supabase first** (Required):
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to **SQL Editor**
   - Copy and paste the entire content of `database/setup-database.sql`
   - Click **Run**
   - Go to **Settings** → **API** and copy:
     - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - **anon public** key → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - *(Optional, for **large goal image upload**)* In Supabase **Storage**, create a public bucket named **`goal-images`** and add a read policy as described in **`docs/STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.md`**. Add **`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`** (the **service_role** secret from the same API page) to Vercel or `.env.local`—server-only, never expose to the browser.
2. Click the **Deploy with Vercel** button above
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Click **Deploy** to start the Vercel setup flow
5. When Vercel asks for environment variables, add:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SITE_PASSWORD` (set a strong password)
   - *(Optional)* `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — same **service_role** value as above; recommended for **large goal** image uploads
6. Continue and finish the deployment
7. After deployment finishes, open your site:
   - In Vercel, open your new project → **Deployments** (or **Project**)
   - Click the **Production** URL (it looks like `https://your-project.vercel.app`)

### Local Development (Advanced)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/con2000us/Wilbur-s-rewardbook.git
cd wilburs-rewardbook
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file and add your credentials:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SITE_PASSWORD=your-strong-password-here
# Optional: large goal image uploads — Settings → API → service_role (server-only)
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_secret
```

4. Run database migrations:
Execute `database/setup-database.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor (recommended), or run the individual migration files under `database/migrations/`.

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## 🚀 Quick Deploy / 快速部署

### One-Click Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/con2000us/Wilbur-s-rewardbook&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,SITE_PASSWORD)

**Steps:**
1. **Set up Supabase first** (Required):
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
   - Copy and paste the entire content of `database/setup-database.sql`
   - Click **Run** to create all database tables, functions, and triggers
   - ⚠️ **Important**: This step is **required** - the app won't work without it!
   - Go to **Settings** → **API** and copy:
     - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - **anon public** key → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - *(Optional, for **large goal image upload**)* Create public Storage bucket **`goal-images`** and policies per **`docs/STORAGE_BUCKET_SETUP.md`**.

2. Click the "Deploy with Vercel" button above
3. Sign in with GitHub
4. Add your environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
   - `SITE_PASSWORD` - **Required**: Set a strong password to protect your site
   - *(Optional)* `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - **service_role** from the same API page; recommended for large goal uploads (keep secret)
5. Click "Deploy"
6. Done! 🎉

> 💡 **Note**: The database setup (`database/setup-database.sql`) must be run **before** or **after** deployment, but it's **required** for the app to function. Supabase doesn't automatically create tables from code - you need to run the SQL script manually.
